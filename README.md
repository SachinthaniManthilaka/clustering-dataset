This  is about unsupervised learning , so I let the algorithm discover natural groupings in the data. The outcome is customer segments that businesses can target with tailored strategies.I have cleaned the data → picked the right features → scaled them → clustered with K-Means → validated with the Elbow Method → visualized → and interpreted .
